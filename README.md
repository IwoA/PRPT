7. Using R and Python in solving basic financial problems, building simple applications

### Projects

- A solution of a selected financial problem by creating an application or code to automate repetitive actions on real or artificial data sets together with a presentation of the results in an R or Python environment

Structure of a project:

- Reading of data. Extra points for using API

- Data transformation (removing NA's, selecting and filtering dataset, joining datasets, calculation of new variables, etc.)

- Data visualisation

- Description of results and methods used
