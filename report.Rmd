## 1st Step - Data structure

**EDA** - Exploratory Data Analysis

Handy packages:

-   [Explore](https://github.com/rolkra/explore)

-   [Esquisse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/esquisse/vignettes/get-started.html)

Load data:

```{r}
#| echo: false
dt <- rio::import("Insider_Trading_Cleaned.csv.zip")
```

There are `r ncol(dt)` columns in the dataset. Column's names are: `r colnames(dt)`

The dataset has `r nrow(dt)` rows.

```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::kable(head(dt))

```

-   Is the dataset complete? (Any missing values?)

-   How many companies are included?

-   What is the time span?

-   How many insiders are included?

-   What type of transactions are considered?

-   Types of columns

-   What else?

## 2nd Step - Research/Modeling

### Insider trade value vs date traded open and close

Since we have so many traders who should we include in our analysis? (What type of graph should be used? Maybe [raincloud plots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz2gHnaqX2w)?)

## 3rd Step - Conclusions
